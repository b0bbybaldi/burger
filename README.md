# Bucketlist

Bucketlist is a project created for an assignment which allows users to interact from the browser to a database to compare their results with those stored to add activities that they have done or want to do in their life.

The project works with javascript, using node and downloadable node components that allow for interactivity with user and further program dynamics. NPM programs installed which allow users to add activities and their completion status. 

It also relies heavily on the use of Heroku, Jaws DB, and Mysql databases for functionality.

## Built using:

Javascript, Node, NPM packages, Mysql, JawsDB, Heroku, Console or Terminal for Mac users

## How to use:

Users have to initialize code using npm init -y command in Terminal once they are in the folder with server.js file. Once initiated and JSON package created then the modules should be installed using the npm install command. 

Once all packages have been installed then the program can run using node server.js to run app through browser from a given port. This app will display a list of product out of which user will choose type and quantity, then the program will check if there is enough stock, if there is it will ouput a total and update the new quantity, if not it will prompt for something else. This projects handles user error when inputing values.
